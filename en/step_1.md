## Introduction

Create a game in which you have to guide a parrot through scrolling pipes to score points.

This project uses moving obstacles to create the feeling of movement. Pipes move across the stage from right to left.

There is one Pipe sprite which gets cloned (copied) and moved to create lots of obstacles.

### What you will make

Click the green flag to start the game. Press the space bar to flap, and try to fly through the gaps in the pipes! You'll score 1 point for every pipe that you manage to get through.
