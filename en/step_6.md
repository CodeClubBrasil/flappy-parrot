## Make Flappy fly

Next, we want Flappy to flap upwards when you press the space bar. You'll need to time your taps to get through the gaps in the pipes. 

+ Add the following code to make Flappy fly upwards when you tap the spacebar:

+ Now you need to get Flappy's wings flapping. 

    Click on the __Costumes__ tab and name the costumes **wings up** and **wings down**.

+ Can you make Flappy's costume change to __wings down__ when you press space and then __wings up__ half way through the upward movement?

You'll need to use `switch costume to` {.blocklooks} blocks.

You'll need to split the upward motion in half so that you can change costume at the beginngin and in the middle.

Split your code like this:

And add blocks to `switch costume to` {.blocklooks} __wings down__ at the beginning and __wings up__ in the middle.

Your code should look like this:

+ Now you can test your code, but nothing bad happens if you hit a pipe.
